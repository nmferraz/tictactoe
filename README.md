# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this project I created the game "Tic Tac Toe", in which it is possible to choose if we believe to use the X or the O, and then play against the program. <br><br>
My purpose for developing this project was to improve my JavaScript skills.<br><br>
This project was developed only in HTML, CSS and JS.<br><br>
